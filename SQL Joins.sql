What is Self-Join in SQL Server?

Joining a table by itself is called self-join in SQL Server. 
When we have some relation between the columns within the same table

/*
In this example, we create an "Employees" table with 
three columns: "EmployeeID," "EmployeeName," and "ManagerID." "EmployeeID" 
is set as the primary key to ensure unique values for each employee.


We then insert sample data into the "Employees" table, representing a simple hierarchy:

Alice and Bob report to Carol.
Carol reports to David.
David is a top-level manager with no manager.
Eve also reports to David.
You can use SQL queries to retrieve 
information about employees and their managers based on this table structure. */
