--  Clauses in SQL Server:
/*------------------------------
The SQL Server supports the following clauses

1] Where (Filtering the records in a table)
2] Order by clause (sorting the records in ascending or descending order)
3] Top n clause (Fetching top n records)
4] Group by clause (Grouping a set of rows)
5] Having Clause (Filtering the data like where clause) */

------------------------------
-- Order By Clause
/*------------------------------


What is Order By Clause and its need in SQL Server?

1] The Order By Clause in SQL Server is used for sorting the data either in ascending 
   or descending order of a query based on a specified column or list of columns. 
   That means if you want to sort the output or result of a query either in ascending or 
   descending order then you need to use SQL Server Order by Clause. 


Points to remember while working with Order By Clause in SQL Server:

1] By default, the Order By Clause in SQL Server will sort the data in ascending order.
2] If you want to arrange the data in descending order then you must have to use the DESC keyword. 
3] The Order By Clause can be applied to any data type column in the table. 
4] This clause will arrange the data temporarily but not in the permanent store. 
5] The Order By Clause can only be used in Select Statements. */

------------------------------------
--       Top n Clause
/*----------------------------------

1] The Top n Clause in SQL Server is used to specify the number of data rows to return. 
2] In large tables with thousands or millions of data rows, 
   it takes more time to return all the records, which cause database performance issue.
   To fix this problem, we can return the specified number 
   of data rows from a table using Top n Clause in SQL Server. */

-- Group By Clause in SQL Server
/*---------------------------------------

1] The Group by Clause in SQL Server is used to divide similar types of records or 
   data as a group and then return. 
2] If we use group by clause in the query then we should 
   use grouping/aggregate function such as count(), sum(), max(), min(), and avg() functions.*/
