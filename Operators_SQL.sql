What is an Operator in SQL Server?

An operator is a symbol that performs some 
specific operation on operands or expressions. These operators are classified as follows in SQL Server.

1] Assignment operator (=,-=,+=,*=,/=)
2] Arithmetic operator
3] Comparison operator
4] Logical operator
5] Set operator

LIKE Operator in SQL Server:

This is one of the most frequently used operators in SQL Server. 
The LIKE operator in SQL Server is used to search for character

Understanding the WildCard Characters:

You can use the following wildcard characters with the LIKE operator in SQL Server.

1] %       symbol represents any no of characters in the expression.
2] _       will represent a single character in the expression.
3] The []  symbol indicates a set of characters in the expression.
4] [^]     will represent any single character, not within the specified range */

/*
Differences between UNION and UNION ALL Operator in SQL Server

From the output, it is very clear that UNION removes 
duplicate rows whereas UNION ALL does not remove the duplicate rows. 
When we use a UNION operator to remove the duplicate rows from the result set, 
the SQL server has to do a distinct operation which is time-consuming. 
For this reason, UNION ALL is much faster than UNION. 


1]  
For UNION and UNION ALL to work, the Number, Data types, 
and the order of the columns in the select statements should be the same. 
If you want to sort, the results of UNION or UNION ALL, 
the ORDER BY clause should be used on the last SELECT */
